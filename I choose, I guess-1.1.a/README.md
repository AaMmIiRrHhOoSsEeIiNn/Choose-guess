HI! 
This is an updated version of Choose-Guess game.
We have a variable: Repeat

This is a sample output:


Enter start of range: 1
Enter end of range: 1500
Enter how many times process repeat?
 ->5
#So 5 times RandomNumber will choose and each time computer try to guess it:

Repeat:1
Random Number is 1194
Guess:1 ->> 750      
Guess:2 ->> 1125     
Guess:3 ->> 1312     
Guess:4 ->> 1218     
Guess:5 ->> 1171     
Guess:6 ->> 1194     
FOUND.

Repeat:2
Random Number is 529 
Guess:1 ->> 750      
Guess:2 ->> 375      
Guess:3 ->> 562
Guess:4 ->> 468
Guess:5 ->> 515
Guess:6 ->> 538
Guess:7 ->> 526
Guess:8 ->> 532
Guess:9 ->> 529
FOUND.

Repeat:3
Random Number is 664
Guess:1 ->> 750
Guess:2 ->> 375
Guess:3 ->> 562
Guess:4 ->> 656
Guess:5 ->> 703
Guess:6 ->> 679
Guess:7 ->> 667
Guess:8 ->> 661
Guess:9 ->> 664
FOUND.

Repeat:4
Random Number is 920
Guess:1 ->> 750
Guess:2 ->> 1125
Guess:3 ->> 937
Guess:4 ->> 843
Guess:5 ->> 890
Guess:6 ->> 913
Guess:7 ->> 925
Guess:8 ->> 919
Guess:9 ->> 922
Guess:10 ->> 920
FOUND.

Repeat:5
Random Number is 1386
Guess:1 ->> 750
Guess:2 ->> 1125
Guess:3 ->> 1312
Guess:4 ->> 1406
Guess:5 ->> 1359
Guess:6 ->> 1382
Guess:7 ->> 1394
Guess:8 ->> 1388
Guess:9 ->> 1385
Guess:10 ->> 1386
FOUND.

# In the end a vector show us (( Number of Guess )) in each Repeat to reach the RandomNumber:
[6, 9, 9, 10, 10]

# MAX guess that we need to guess a RandomNumber that is in range(1500)(?)
MAXIMUM:10
# MIN guess that we need to guess a RandomNumber that is in range(1500)(?)
MINIMUM:6

# Please think about two above variables
